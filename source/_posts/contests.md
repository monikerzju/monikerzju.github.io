#### Dream Cup 2021
- Our team won 1st place (even some Xiangshan developers participated in the competition).
- As the team leader, we integrated some designs of Amipsel into the Linux-capable ZJV core for the 2nd generation.
- ZJV 2nd generation supported RV64GC and reached 3.2/MHz in Coremark as a dual-issue processor.
- We integrated some security features such as randomized cache, RegVault and Memory Domain in the core.

#### NSCSCC 2021
- Our team won 2nd place in the final.
- I led the team to design and implement the Pmon-capable [Amipsel](https://github.com/monikerzju/amipsel) core.
- As the prototype of the 2nd generation of ZJV core designed in the 2nd OSCPU project, Amipsel broke the performance record in National Computer System Capability Challenge (NSCSCC).

#### AI Reversi 2020
- My [AI reversi](https://github.com/monikerzju/zju-ai-reversi) was the champion and won every match against others.
- I chose alpha-beta pruning-based search method for efficiency on the platform.
- I optimized the heuristic search algorithm via playing against an adversary trained by reinforcement learning.
