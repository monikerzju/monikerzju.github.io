I am a student at **Zhejiang University**. I am advised by Professor [Rui Chang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/0019220).

- ðŸ”¬ My research interest lies roughly in Computer Architecture and Operating System. I am particular interested in solving real-world problems and creating impact on real systems through a stream of novel research. 

- ðŸ“– I joined in the 2nd [OSCPU](https://github.com/OSCPU) project and built a 110nm Linux-capable RISC-V processor with Rocket SoC. We optimized the processor for a second generation to reach 3.2/MHz in Coremark. In [Dream Cup](http://cyictc.yeeol.com/) Competition based on FPGA, our processor narrowly ... and won the 1st place. We also integrated some security features in our processor: (1) a hybrid secure cache against side channel attacks, (2) a QARMA crypto-engine for confidentiality and integrity of fine-grained runtime data, (3) Memory Domain primitives and a modified kernel to efficiently offer unlimited isolation domains for user processes.

- ðŸ“‹ Currently, I am working on: (1) analysis on the vulnerabilites of processors' RTL designs, (2) accelerating EVM via database techniques and heterogenous system designs.
